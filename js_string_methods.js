/*List three string methods and explain what they do.*/
String methods allow the user to work with strings, a few of which are indexOf(), search(), and substr().
	indexOf() returns the whereabouts of the first use of certain text within a string.
	search() is a method that searches a string for a value and returns with the positive match.
	While substr() is similar to slice(), the difference is that the second parameter will state the length of the extracted portion. 
/*Explain the following Math methods*/

/*Math.round()*/
- Returns "x" rounded to the nearest integer.
/*Math.floor()*/
- Math.floor is the opposite of Math.round, returning "x" rounded down to its nearest integer. 
/*Math.Min() & Math.Max()*/
- Using these Math methods will allow the user to find the lowest and highest value in a list of assorted arguments.

/*Math.random()*/
- Hence the word "random," the method will return a random number between an inclusive number such as zero and an exclusive number like one.
